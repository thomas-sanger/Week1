# Week 1: Move the Ball

My very first JavaScript project

## Usage

1. Include main.js into any HTML file with an element with an ID of "ball"

```html
<div id="ball"></div>
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

2. The script will detect when the left or right arrow keys are pressed and will move the ball element accordingly.
